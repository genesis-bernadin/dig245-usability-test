       <h1> METHODOLOGY </h1>
       <body> In this assignment, we assessed the usability of the <a href = "https://www.ncdot.gov/dmv/offices-services/online/Pages/default.aspx">North Carolina’s
         Department of Movtor Vehicles (DMV)</a> website. This site serves as the official
         online platform for NC residents to receive information on relevant
         automotive services, such as  driver licenses and vehicle registrations.
         Given the neccessity of DMV’s, we examined the accessibility and
         intuitiveness of the website’s features.

          <br></br>

        <body> We had  two participants perform the following tasks and timed their completion:
          <br></br>
            <div class = "list"
            <ul>
              <li>Make an appointment </li>
              <li>Locate Hours </li>
              <li>Order a replacement license/duplicate ID</li>
              <li>Access License Services</li>
              <li> Send a message </li>

          <br> </br>
          <br> </br>


          <h2> RECOMMENDATIONS </h2>
          <div class = "bodyRec">
            <body> Based on our assessments of the particpants, we conclude that
            the NC DMV website can be improved through the following recommendations.
          </body>
          <br> </br>
          <body> For one,  basic infomration such as the hours, location, and contact
            information should be placed at the footer. This could be helpful
            for users who would rather scroll to find information as opposed to
            clicking through different pages. </body>
          <br> </br>
          <body> Likewise, this website could benefit from implementing a more
            prominent header, such that the “Home” and/or subsequent pages are
             easier to locate. </body>

          <br> </br>

          <body> Ultimately, the website’s current design is fairly intutitive,
            however, with these slight modifications it would perform better on
            the usability scale. </body>
